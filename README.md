# node-docker
Boilerplate for new Node.js projects that run on Docker. Includes a starter kit for APIs and React + Redux + Webpack powered frontend.

This boilerplate was extracted from an existing node project and is a `Work In Progress`.

# Quickstart

Run `docker-compose up --build` from the base directory.

`http://localhost:3000` should give you the frontend and `http://localhost:4040` should give you the API.

Use `docker-compose run api npm test` to run the API tests.

# TODO

  1. ~~Make sure API tests are working~~
  2. Use the Redux store in web
  3. Better README
