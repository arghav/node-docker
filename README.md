# node-docker
Boilerplate for new Node.js projects that run on Docker. Includes a starter kit for APIs with Express, and a React + Redux + Webpack powered frontend with hot reloading.

This is a work in progress. Feel free to create issues for any bugs or problems you face.

# Quickstart

Run `docker-compose up` from the base directory.

If everything goes well `http://localhost:3000` should give you the frontend, and `http://localhost:4040` should be your the API endpoint.

Use `docker-compose run api npm test` to run the API tests provided.

# TODO
  1. Use API in Web
  2. Better README
